# GA Overflow - Readme

We created a fullstack application with CRUD operations for General Assembly students, graduates and tutors to share and exchange advice about the course and coding.  


## Description

The website was designed to provide a space for General Assembly students and alumni to share advice about coding and careers and to ask others working on the course for help. The site uses a blog style format for logged in users to publish posts and comment on posts from others. 

The application has the following features: 



* Write and publish blog with title, summary, text, images
* Display blogs in order of the most recently published
* Add comments to blogs
* Edit and delete blog posts
* Register a new user and login and logout
* Search function for blog titles, summaries and text

We developed the fullstack application using MERN stack, with the following technologies: 

* MongoDB - document database for holding the blog post and user data
* Express(.js) - web application framework for Node.js 
* React(.js) - client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - JavaScript web server

## Getting Started


### Dependencies

You will need to check you have [node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) installed before the application will run.

The application uses the following dependencies:  

* Bcrypt
* Cors
* Dotenv
* Express
* Jsonwebtoken
* Mongoose
* Mongoose-hidden
* Mongoose-unique-validator

### Installing

The GitHub repos for the application are available: 

Front end - [https://github.com/neilmurcho13/GA-overflow-client](https://github.com/neilmurcho13/GA-overflow-client)

Back end - [https://github.com/neilmurcho13/GA-overflow-backend](https://github.com/neilmurcho13/GA-overflow-backend)


### Executing program

Both the client and the database need to be running at the same time. 

The backend runs on port 3000.  

Client - run from inside the client folder

```
yarn start:client
```
